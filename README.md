============

This is a **Base Project** to study **Sorting Algorithms** and put some implementations about this topic.

## Getting Started

To use this repository you need to make a **git clone**:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/lpmatos/sorting-algorithms.git -b master
```

This will give access on your **local machine** to this project.

## Organization

* **.github** we have template to create **Actions** on **GitHub**.
* **/code** in this folder we have a **Python** scripts.
* **/docs** is the directory where we have all documentation files.
* **CHANGELOG.md** is a versioning file usend to control development versions.
* **docker-compose.yml** is the **Docker** container orchestrator.
* **Dockerfile** is a file used to set up your **Docker** environment.
* **Makefile** is a file containing a set of automation policies.
* **README.md** is an optional file. A human-readable **README** file.
* The files found in the project root are support files to others contexts.

## Pre-Requisites

* **Python**.
* **Docker**.
* **docker-compose**.

## Containers

It's set at [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) the **Containers** required for application execution.

**Container** | **Description** | **Dockerfile**

## Running pip

The **pip** is a command line program. When you install **pip**, a **pip** command is added to your system, which can be run from the command prompt as follows:

```bash
$ pip <pip arguments>
```

If you cannot run the pip command directly (possibly because the location where it was installed isn't on your operating systems **PATH**) then you can run **pip** via the **Python** interpreter:

```bash
$ python -m pip <pip arguments>
```

On **Windows**, the py launcher can be used:

```bash
$ py -m pip <pip arguments>
```

## Installing Packages

### Pip

The **pip** supports installing from **PyPI**, version control, local projects, and directly from distribution files.

The most common scenario is to install from **PyPI** using Requirement specifiers.

```bash
$ pip install SomePackage            # latest version
$ pip install SomePackage==1.0.4     # specific version
$ pip install somePackage>=1.0.4     # minimum version
```

### Pipenv

**Pipenv** is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the **Python** world. **Windows** is a firsts-class citizen, in our world.

It automatically creates and manages a **virtualenv** for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your **Pipfile** as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important **Pipfile.lock**, which is used to produce deterministic builds.

#### Installation

```bash
$ pip install pipenv
```

#### Create a TOML Spec Pipfile

You can build the **Pipfile** to specifying:

* Versions of a Package.
* Versions of **Python**.
* Basic configurations.

#### Pipenv Workflow

Clone/create project repository:

```bash
$ cd myproject
```

Install from **Pipfile**, if there is one:

```bash
$ pipenv install
```

Install from **Pipfile** dev:

```bash
$ pipenv install --dev
```

## Requirement File

**Requirement File** are files containing a list of items to be installed using **pip** install like so:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Logically, a **Requirement File** is just a list of **pip** install arguments placed in a file. Note that you should not rely on the items in the file being installed by **pip** in any particular order.

## Docker

### Build

To **Build** the image:

```
docker image build -t <IMAGE_NAME> -f <PATH_DOCKERFILE> <PATH_CONTEXT_DOCKERFILE>
```

or

```
docker image build -t <IMAGE_NAME> . (This context)
```

Explain:

* **IMAGE_NAME**:
    * Image **Name/Tag**.
* **PATH_DOCKERFILE**:
    * **Dockerfile** location.
    * Where is the full path to **Dockerfile** located?
* **PATH_CONTEXT_DOCKERFILE**:
    * **Dockerfile** context.
    * Where is the **Dockerfile**?

#### Run the Container with the image

* Running the **Container** in **Detached mode**/**Background**:

```
docker container run -d -p <LOCAL_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT> <IMAGE_NAME>
```

* Running the **Container** in **Interactive mode**:

```
docker container run -it --rm --name <CONTAINER_NAME> -p <LOCAL_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT> <IMAGE_NAME>
```

### Basic Commands

* Windows

```
winpty docker.exe run -it --rm <IMAGE_NAME> <COMMAND>
```

* Showing all local images:

```
docker images
```

or

```
docker image ls
```

* Showing all Active or Inactive **Containers**:

```
docker ps -a
```

* Showing all Active **Containers**:

```
docker ps
```

* Entering an Active **Container**:

```
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> <COMMAND>
```
